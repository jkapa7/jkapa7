## About me
<div>
Using the latest technologies available I am willing to grow and challenge myself in environments where I can learn and keep creating amazing dynamic experiences that live on the internet. I had the pleasure to coordinate and guide a group of +20 students for more than 12 weeks helping them in their process of integration, adaptation, and development during the course of the bootcamp Soy Henry in my labors as a Teaching Assistant..
